## Why Use StreetEasy Scraper?

This project provides a powerful and adaptable framework for gathering real estate data from StreetEasy. Whether for analysis, research, or building custom applications, the StreetEasy Scraper simplifies the data collection process with features like:

  <Card title="BrightData Integration" icon="puzzle">
    Leverage BrightData's Web Unlocker to handle complex website defenses like
    CAPTCHAs at scale.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible Scraping Methods" icon="setting">
    Choose the method that fits your needs: **Synchronous** for immediate
    results with a simpler setup, or **Asynchronous** for scale and higher
    success rates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Concurrent Sync Processing" icon="document">
    The synchronous profile leverages **multithreading** to process multiple
    addresses in parallel for faster results at smaller scale.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Efficient Async Workflow" icon="rocket">
    An asynchronous workflow with a **FastAPI webhook** and background
    processing handles BrightData callbacks for scalable and reliable data
    collection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure Tunneling" icon="cloudflare">
    Use **Cloudflared tunnels** to securely expose your webhook to the public
    internet without opening inbound firewall ports.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enhanced Security" icon="seti:lock">
    Implement robust **Cloudflare IP whitelisting and SSL/TLS encryption** to
    protect your webhook endpoint.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Robust Database" icon="seti:db">
    Store and manage your addresses and scraped data reliably using a
    **PostgreSQL** database.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simplified Deployment" icon="seti:docker">
    Easily deploy and manage all project services using **Docker Compose** with
    distinct profiles for synchronous and asynchronous modes.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How it Works

The StreetEasy Scraper operates by:

1.  **Providing Addresses:** Either seed the database with addresses from nyc.gov using the built-in tool, or add your own list of addresses to the database.
2.  **Scraping Data:** Run either the synchronous or asynchronous scraper profile to collect data from StreetEasy for the provided addresses, using BrightData Web Unlocker.
3.  **Storing Results:** Scraped data is saved directly into the PostgreSQL database, associated with the original address.

The asynchronous workflow adds complexity with a dedicated webhook to receive callbacks from BrightData when a job is ready, and a background process to fetch and process the results.
