Welcome to the documentation for the `streeteasy-scraper-monorepo` project! This repository houses a collection of tools designed to automate the process of gathering data from StreetEasy.com and related sources for real estate analysis and other purposes.

At its core, this project aims to provide a flexible and efficient way to collect structured data from property listings on StreetEasy, using a database to manage the scraping process and store the results.

## Key Features

- **Address Seeding:** Initialize your database with a list of target addresses from external sources.
- **Flexible Scraping Methods:** This project offers two distinct methods for scraping:
  - **Synchronous:** A simpler, multi-threaded approach for direct requests.
  - **Asynchronous:** A more robust and scalable workflow leveraging BrightData's callbacks for high-volume or longer-running jobs.
- **Webhook Integration:** A dedicated service to handle callbacks from BrightData for efficient asynchronous job processing.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Easily deploy and manage all project components using Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Cloudflared Tunneling:** Securely expose the webhook to the public internet for asynchronous workflows.
- **Structured Data Output:** Scraped data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for easy access and analysis.

## Why Use This Project?

Whether you're a data analyst, researcher, or developer, this project provides a foundation for building datasets of StreetEasy information. Its modular design and use of established technologies make it adaptable for various data collection needs. The inclusion of **both synchronous and asynchronous scraping methods** allows you to choose the approach that best suits your scale and requirements â€“ the synchronous method for simplicity and quick starts, and the asynchronous method for its scalability and reliability with BrightData.

## Technologies Used

The `streeteasy-scraper-monorepo` is built using a modern Python stack and leverages powerful infrastructure tools:

- **Python:** The primary programming language.
- **uv:** A fast Python package installer and resolver.
- **FastAPI:** For building the asynchronous webhook service.
- **SQLAlchemy:** ORM for interacting with the database.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database for storing addresses and scraped data.
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** For containerization and orchestration.
- **Cloudflared:** To expose the webhook publicly via secure tunnels.
- **BrightData WebUnlocker:** A third-party service used for web scraping.

This introduction has provided a brief overview of the project and its two primary scraping methods. The following sections will guide you through setting up the synchronous scraping profile, understanding the system's design, and then diving into the details of the asynchronous setup and data usage.
