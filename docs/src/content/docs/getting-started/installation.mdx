# Installation

This section will guide you through the steps to get the `streeteasy-scraper-monorepo` project running using Docker. Since the project is containerized, you primarily need Docker and Docker Compose installed.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **Git:** For cloning the repository.
- **Docker:** The project is designed to run in Docker containers. Install Docker Desktop or Docker Engine based on your operating system from [https://www.docker.com/get-started/](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).
- **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is typically included with Docker Desktop installations. If you installed Docker Engine separately, you might need to install Docker Compose as well. Refer to the Docker documentation for your system.

## Cloning the Repository

First, you need to clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nedhmn/streeteasy-scraper-monorepo.git
```

This will create a directory named `streeteasy-scraper-monorepo` in your current location. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd streeteasy-scraper-monorepo
```

You have successfully obtained the project files. The next step is to configure the project with your specific settings and credentials before running the Docker containers.
